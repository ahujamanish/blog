Summary: Requesting push notification permissions in iOS 8 is pretty simple. you first create UIUserNotificationSettings and then register the settings on UIApplication. 

 ```
 UIUserNotificationSettings* notificationSettings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:(UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound) categories:nil];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
```
